# Hive Frontend Challenge

## Instructions to run project

In the current directory, run `npm start`.

The window containing both the multiple and single-option dropdown demo should appear.

The items being passed down to the <Dropdown> component originates from App.js. Feel free to add/remove/create any lists to pass in as items to the Dropdown component.

## Quick overview of <Dropdown> component

<Dropdown> takes in three props, one of which is optional. A label is required (which goes on the top left) and an array of items is also required. Optionally, you can specify if you would like the <Dropdown> to handle multiple (checkboxes), or set multiple={false} to have a list of single-option inputs.
